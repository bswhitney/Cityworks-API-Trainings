## General Questions
The following are questions from courses that are in the process of being answered.
* Is there a way of accessing a range of values using the API? For example, if I wanted to search for work orders with a WorkOrderId between 100 and 140, how would I do that?
* When you add an activity link (type: parent) between two work activities, does the source activity become the parent or the child?
* When you remove an activity link rather than deleting the link, does it set the relationship type to `null`?
## JavaScript / Web Development Questions
