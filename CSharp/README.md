# Cityworks-CSharp-API-Training-Live
Current Cityworks API training samples for the C# SDK.

## Folder Explanations
The **CSharp-Live_15-4** and **CSharp-Web_15-4** folders contain the Visual Studio 2017 projects currently used for live and web training, respectively. These were rewritten from the deprecated version for use with Cityworks 15.4. Aside from rewritten pseudo-code, reorganized and optimized code, and the use of the ActivityLink service, very little has changed from the deprecated version.

## Version
The sample projects in **CSharp-Live_15-4** and **CSharp-Web_15-4** are up to date with Cityworks 15.4. Note that projects may or may not work for other versions of the software.

## Disclaimer
Azteca Systems, its products, and its employees are not responsible for your implementation of this code. This code is to simply illustrate how the C# SDK can be interacted with rather than provide a ready-built program for your production environment.
