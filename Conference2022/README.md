# 2022 Cityworks User Content API Training Samples
The files in this directory were created for use with API training courses at the 2022 Cityworks User Conference in Salt Lake City, Utah.

## Project Explanations
The **JavaScript** folder contains the beginning and ending points for a small web application to be turned into a Cityworks plugin that uses the JavaScript SDK. This application simply creates unattached work orders, giving the user the ability to add information to the Location and Text1 fields in the work order table. 

The **CSharp** folder contains the beginning and ending points for a small WinForms application built in Visual Studio using C# and the Cityworks SDK for C#. The application is a small user-interface that allows you to do some data management surrounding work order task dates.

The **Python** folder contains the beginning and end points for a Python script that automatically generates custom inspections on assets of a single type, selected by the user in the script. The results of the script are then pushed to an HTML report file that can be viewed by the user afterward.

## Version
These samples are up to date with Cityworks 15.8.
