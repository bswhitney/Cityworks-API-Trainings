# Cityworks-JavaScript-API-Training-Live
Current Cityworks API training samples for the JavaScript SDK. This project uses the Cityworks 15.4 SDK for JavaScript.

## Folder Explanations
The **apiexample-complete** folder contains a stand alone web app that is built using the JavaScript SDK. This app is complete and ready to turn into a Cityworks Plugin. This folder should be used as either reference while working on a duplicate of **apiexample-start** or to create a duplicate to make a plugin.
The **apiexample-start** folder contains a stand alone web app that is built using the JavaScript SDK. This app is not  complete, acting as a starting point for the user. Remember to duplicate the folder before editing it.

## Version
The sample projects in **apiexample-complete** and **apiexample-start** are up to date with Cityworks 15.4. Note that projects may or may not work for other versions of the software.
